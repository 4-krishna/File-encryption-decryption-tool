# Brainfuck Encryption/Decryption Tool

**Description:**
Welcome to the *uniquely* brilliant Brainfuck Encryption/Decryption Tool! If you’ve ever dreamed of combining the power of encryption with the challenge and excitement of programming in Brainfuck, then this is your ultimate destination. While it may not be the fastest, it's certainly one of the most *memorable* ways to secure your files. This Python-based tool encrypts and decrypts your files using the fascinating (and slightly chaotic) Brainfuck language, pushing your encryption experience to new, mind-bending heights. 

**Features:**

- **Encryption and Decryption:** Absolutely, it can encrypt and decrypt files. In fact, it might even give you a newfound appreciation for modern encryption methods once it’s done.
- **Multiple File Formats Supported:** It handles various file formats, like `.mp3`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.txt`, and even more obscure ones, giving you flexibility and options. 
- **Brainfuck Algorithm:** Who needs conventional algorithms when you can engage your mind in the beautiful chaos of Brainfuck? It’s not just encryption – it’s an experience.
- **Command-line Interface:** A simple CLI that lets you dive straight into the action, and lets you feel like a true code warrior as you wield Brainfuck to secure your files.
- **File Input and Output:** Specify your input and output file paths like a pro, and experience the magic of Brainfuck working its “efficiency” (eventually).
